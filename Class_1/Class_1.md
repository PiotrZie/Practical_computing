Practical Computing, Class 1 by Paweł Koteja, Instructions v1, 2021-06-21

# Class 1

#  Organising data in spreadsheet or spreadsheet-like format, relations between tables

## Overview, organisation and the required materials

The class will consist on two parts: 

1. A quasi-lecture, with the information on how to organise data stored on computer, from the highest level issue (how to organize folders with data files) to the lowest level (how to organize information inside simple data bases).

2. A practical part, in which we will both together and independently work on proper organisation of the information in Excel spreadsheets. For this part we will need examples of your files with any kind of data stored in Excel, and I ask each student to have prepared at least one such file, which could be shown to other participants of the course at least by sharing the screen in MSTeams. This can be any kind of data, either from your actual scientific work, or from some classes you had years ago as undergrads, etc. Please, do NOT modify the files with the idea of making them “better”, based on what you can learn already from the instructions to the next classes, or what you have learned recently form your supervisor. Actually, I would especially appreciate if you share files you suspect are NOT examples of properly organized databases. Obviously, for this part you must also have either Excel (or OpenOffice) on your computer.
   Unlike all the remaining classes, in this one we will work on data stored and processed in the most popular spreadsheet – Excel. Although at least some of my colleagues-instructors seem to represent an opinion that Excel is an abomination, and one of the purposes of the course is to persuade students to not use it at all, I do not agree with such fundamentalist attitude. The reasons are as follows:

- Excel (or other similar spreadsheets, e.g. in Open Office) can be efficiently used to organize methodologically proper databases and for efficient data processing, at least for relatively small datasets (by “small” I mean datasets consisting of several tens of columns and several thousand rows).
- A properly organized Excel database can be with a couple “clicks” converted to pure-text files of a desired format, such as will be discussed on a next class, and which are the typical “subject” of work in more complex workflows. 
- Learning proper, systematic usage of formulas in cells of Excel provides a good basis for capturing the idea of processing data with programming languages. Several main concepts are nearly the same, beginning with using in the formulas variables (cell addresses) instead of fixed values, through mathematical and logical expressions, to concepts of searching, selecting and matching information from different sources. 
- Finally, and most importantly, in my opinion the problem is not a usage, but a widespread misuse  of his tool. For most of students Excel or an Excel-like application is the first data-analysis tool they encounter. Courses of using Excel quite often contribute to the misuse, because they are focused on learning how to make some fancy things, such as colourful, pseudo-three dimensional graphs, or richly decorated tables with elaborated formatting, rather than the fundamentals of the data organisation. Most of us will continue to use Excel for at least some tasks, so let us do that properly. 
This said I must immediately say that this class is NOT intended to be a course of using Excel and its advanced capacities. We will only discuss organisation of data in Excel spreadsheet, and perhaps the simplest schemes of the data processing.

## Specific topics to be discussed
- Where to store data: organisation of a hierarchical system for storing data and associated files.
- Naming folders and files.
- Fundamental rules of organisation of simple databases: the data records structure.
- Naming variables (columns) in a dataset.
- Using simple formulas for quick data processing.
- Typical errors in the database spreadsheet organisation.
- Metadata information.
