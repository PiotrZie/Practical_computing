# Text files, text editors and regular expressions

At the very basic level there are two types of computer files: text files and everything else, usually called binary files. Loosely speaking text files contain lines of text and very little else and are human readable, while the content of binary files is not human readable, but it has to be interpreted by a dedicated program to convey meaningful information for the user. The distinction between text and binary files may, at the beginning, seem a bit unclear, but hopefully things will become clearer as we move on.

Text files (sometimes called also plain text) are commonly used for storing and exchanging various types of information. Therefore an understanding of their structure and quirks is essential for any biologist.

We're start with an example.
To make things confusing, files we usually open and save in one of the most popular text editing program, MS Word, are actually not text files, but rather binary files containing text. When open in MS Word the file looks like this:
